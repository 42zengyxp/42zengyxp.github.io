<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Answers:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">Most people hold the mistaken view that Arabic is just one Language that all Arabs understand, speak and write.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">Written Arabic and pan-Arabic mean roughly the same. Classical Arabic and Modern Arabic are two different kinds of written Arabic. Colloquial Arabic is the everyday spoken language, which is different from country to country.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">Educated people who speak different languages can use it to communicate with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">4.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">An educated Egyptian would use pan-Arabic for</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">a.</span><span class="s3">  </span><span class="s1">making a speech,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">b.</span><span class="s3">  </span><span class="s1">talking to an Iraqi, and</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">c.</span><span class="s3">  </span><span class="s1">but he would use colloquial Arabic</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">d.</span><span class="s3">  </span><span class="s1">while talking to his friends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">5.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">Colloquial English is recognized as 'real English'; it is written and taught in school. This is not true of colloquial Arabic.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s4"><b>Discussion</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">All living languages change through time. If there is a regular contact among the speakers, there will not be so much difference. On the other hand, if there is no contact among them, the difference until be very wide and the same language will be so different. Because of the desert, three was no social contact among the speakers of Arabic and the colloquial Arabic became so different. But written Arabic is based on The Koran and therefore its form is fixed. So, these two forms of the language are 90 different from each other.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">Because of the language system, it is very difficult for the Arabs to communicate among them. An Iraqi can't communicate with a Saudi by using the spoken language, Therefore, communication is impossible among the uneducated Arabs This form of language isn't taught in schools either. But the educated speakers can communicate among themselves by using the written form of the language. Their talk sounds quite unnatural.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3.</span><span class="s3">    </span><span class="s1">The language system of my country is more or less similar to that of the Arabs. People in different societies speak different languages to talk among themselves. They use their own mother tongues which are completely different from one another, When people of different communities have to communicate among themselves, they use Nepali. To such people, Nepali acts as pan-Arabic. Unlike their system, Nepali is the living language and the majority of the people speak it.</span></p>
