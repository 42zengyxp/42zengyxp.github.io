<p class="p4"><span class="s4">The sunlight reaching Venus is twice as powerful as that reaching the Earth.One long Venusian 'day' is equal to 59 days on earth.  At that time the temperature reaches 450 degrees Centigrade. It is easily hot enough to melt tin or lead. Venus has an atmosphere about 100 times dense as ours. The atmosphere is so thick that you could fly through it without any problem. A seven mile per hour wind there would be strong enough to knock down a tall building here. Because of the clouds of sulphur and sulphuric acid, the Sun's light there is no more than a dark reddish gloom. The light came not from the Sun but from flashes of lightning given off by continual electrical storms. All in all, then Venus turns out to be dramatic though extremely inhospitable.</span></p>
