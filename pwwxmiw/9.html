<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I’d rather live in a village than in a city. A village is fresher than a city because air is not polluted there by industry and vehicles. It's lovelier because of forests, fields and rivers. It's more inspiring to the poets. It's quieter because there's no noise of the people and vehicles. It's more delightful and beautiful. It's closer to the nature. Villagers are simpler and more innocent. So, a village is more praised by poets and writers.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Nurses are trained for two years after they complete their SEE. During their training they have to study and go to visit hospitals. In the end their qualification is equivalent to Intermediate Level. They have to work eight hours a day. Sometimes they have to work in the night and in the day. They work in neat and clean hospitals. There is no risk involved in their job. Normally, they are satisfied with their job. Their responsibility is high. On duty they have to take care of their patients very well. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Policemen are trained for one year. Their training is very hard. In the end their educational qualification does not improve. They are supposed to be employed twenty-four hours a day. Their job is quite risky. They might be killed on duty. They are satisfied with their jobs if there is disturbance in the country. Their responsibility is more. They have to watch the arrested persons carefully.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Miners are trained for a few weeks. No educational qualification is needed for them. Their training does not promote any educational qualification. They have to work eight hours a day. They have a to work in a very unhealthy environment. To work underground is quite risky. They might be killed. Most of the miners aren't satisfied with their jobs. They are responsible to their employers. </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">High school teachers are trained for one year if they are graduate. They have to study and visit schools for practice teaching. In the end of their training, they become technical graduate. Normally they take twenty-four classes a week. But, they have to keep themselves busy preparing their lesson plans and correcting their students’ answer books. They work in the classrooms or in the teachers' room. Most of the teachers are satisfied with their jobs. Their responsibility is more. They are the makers of the future society.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Long distance lorry drivers are trained for six months. They learn how to drive. They have to be familiar with highway signposts. Their training does not help them to promote their educational qualification. Their working hours are not fixed. Sometimes they have to drive more than 15 hours a day. Driving all the time is a boring job. But visiting new places and new people makes them happy. They are responsible to their employers. They have to avoid knocking dawn people and animals along the road. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I think policemen should earn most because their training is very hard and their job is risky and they are on duty all the time. I think miners should earn the least because they are unskilled workers. (Other possible answers)</span></p>
