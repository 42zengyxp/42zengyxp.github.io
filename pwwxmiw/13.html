I play chess very much because I am terrific at chess. Tennis and golf are my favourite games although I'm not quite good at them. There are many more video games which I would like to buy and play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">I think video games are not good things in public places. They are taken as gambling. People come and spend a lot of money on them because they could become addicted and they may steal money to play the machines. Moreover, people waste their valuable time for nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">3.</span><span class="s4">    </span><span class="s3">So far as home video games are concerned, it depends on the players whether re good or bad. We can play two types of game on a home video set games involving physical skill such as football, and intellectual games such as chess. The young people can play games on the ground, but if they take interest in Video game it is a great waste of time, and their physical strength will decrease. Young people need real games. If people are too old to play real games, they can enjoy video games which could be their "close friends. " Intellectual games such as chess are for the old and the young. Here it makes no difference whether you play with a man or with a machine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">4.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">Gambling is risking money on the result of something uncertain. Once people start gambling and lose some money, they can't stop it. They go on risking money whatever may happen. It is the nature of human beings to do what others do. Therefore, gambling in public places is controlled by law. Similarly, money is involved in video games in public places. The more you play, the more you lose, the more you lose and the more you would like to play. So, you become addicted. If you don't have money, you may steal it. It is a waste of your valuable time and money. Not only you are spoilt, the spectators watching your game equally spend their time uselessly. Therefore, I think video games in public places would be controlled by law.</span></p>
