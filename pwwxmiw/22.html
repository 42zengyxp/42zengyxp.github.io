<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>22.4 STRIKING SCENES</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few evenings ago I watched the sun setting behind the mountains. As it lowered in the western sky, its long level rays lit up the green fields of wheat and all the trees and bushes with a golden glowed making everything very clear and distinct. The clouds above the sky began to glow with a golden light, and the mountains were of a lovely purple. The white house a little distance away looked as though they were made of silver.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">When I returned home for the holidays, I found that my parents had made all sorts of changes to the house. When I stood in front of my house, I doubted if it was my house. My parents had made a wall around my house and they had painted it. Then I went through the gate outside. Then I was quite surprised. A garage had been made and many flowers had been planted in front of the house. As I went into the house, I found that all the rooms had been redecorated. When I asked my mother about ail these changes, she replied that my father was thinking of my marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">5.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">I was in a panic. My guests were due to arrive in two hours, and nothing was ready. The room had not been cleaned, the furniture had not been moved to one side, and the carpets had not been rolled. The tables had not been covered with the tablecloth. Wine and food had not been ready. Plates and cutlery had not been laid on the table. I had not changed my clothes. I was quite worried. I thought that it would be a great insult of mine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>22.7 MEMORIES</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">One of the people at work had invited him to the party, so he was there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">He was feeling bored because other people at the party were talking to the persons already known.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">She was sitting at the side of a group.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">4.</span><span class="s2">    </span><span class="s1">They looked at each other, he went closer to her and they started talking.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>HOW I FIRST MET JOHN</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Well, we met at a school in Pokhara. You see I'd just moved to Pokhara because of my job and I didn't really know anybody. There was a program at school. I had to go there. People were talking to each other in their local language. I didn't understand them very much. And I was feeling bored. And then I noticed a boy who looked, as bored as I was. Then I went close to him and we introduced each other. He was John. He had come there with his uncle to spend his holidays. And that's how it all started really.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>MY EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORY</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">It was eleven years ago. I was just five then. My father took me to a cinema. He had a piece of paper at a window. We went to a gate. It was closed. When he showed the paper to a man at the gate, he allowed us go in. It was completely dark inside. There was a black curtain hanging at the gate. The gatekeeper had a torchlight in his hand. He led us to a seat. My father sat on it and I sat on his lap. In front there was a colorful scene. My father told me the story of the film. And I was watching the story in front of my eyes. And I was very happy.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">B: My car had broken down outside the town and I was trying to find out a call box to contact the AA. After walking for a long time, I came near the call box and I saw a man inside. I was waiting for my turn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A: What did you see exactly?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">B: When I reached near the box, I was surprised to find a man inside. He was wearing a blue and rubber boots. He was fat and his back was pressing against the glass. He was bending over the phone. So, I had to wait for my turn. I lit the cigarette and threw the dead match on the ground. Just then I saw something bright red falling in drops from under the call box door. Then I informed the police. </span></p>
