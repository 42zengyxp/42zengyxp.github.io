<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I've cleaned the room and set the furniture properly. I've also asked the catering service to supply food and drink for twenty-five persons. The key is under the mat.  Is it all right if you place the house plants safely? Do you think you could feed the cat? I’ve not invited the neighbors, so could you invite them?</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The party started at six as expected. I didn't have to worry about cleaning, food and drink. There were thirty guests altogether, but the manager of the catering service was fast to enough to manage food and drink for everyone. And the party was over at ten.  It was very interesting but I missed you. I've hoovered the carpet. I 've also put the house plants properly. I've kept the key under the mat as you did.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>8.7 A BUSY TIME</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">I've been getting my life organized recently. I've made a routine to do everything from morning to evening. Yesterday I went to bed at 10 and this morning I got up at five and went to college at 6. After I came back home. In the afternoon I went to the library, I've prepared one-third of English textbook. I've also been doing economics and math. I've not missed any important programs on TV. Last Saturday I went on a picnic with my friends. I haven't been to the restaurant in the evenings with my friends. I've regularly done my homework.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">I've been finding out about holiday jobs over the past couple of weeks. I've not got any job to earn money. Since I came here, I've tried to get all kinds of jobs. I tried to find out the work as a waiter in a hotel. I showed my interest in the kitchen work in a restaurant. I came to this town to get a job and to earn money to enjoy my holiday. I've almost finished the money I brought with me. If I didn't manage any job in a day or two, I'd have no choice except returning home. I haven't even got an outdoor job. I've passed my days visiting different places and meeting different people, but I haven’t got a job yet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">I've been keeping very fit lately. I've started constant and regular exercise. I haven't felt anything about bodily pain and weakness. Before doing exercise, I used to be very dull and I was not interested in my life. I was very unhappy. My working power failed. I felt that my life was a punishment. But these days been walking regularly for one hour a day. I have also been playing football and cricket. I’ve felt fresh when I wake up in the morning. My life has been changing a lot. Although I am poor, my life has become rich.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><b>8.8 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Free practice</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">1.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">I live in Muglin. This town has been expanding for twenty years. In the beginning there were only five hotels and nothing else. But now it has more than one hundred hotels. Three petrol pumps have been doing their services. One high school and three primary schools have been established. In the past only a few vehicles stopped there. But now almost every vehicle has started to stop there. Almost two hundred- night buses have been feeding their passengers. This town also has showed some bad signs which have to be checked. The people of that area have been building a hospital there. It has still been attracting more and more people.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">2.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">My country has been enjoying democracy since 2046 BS.  A democratic constitution has come into effect. General election has taken place five times. The government has been changing frequently. The leaders have shown their love for the chair. Nobody has been thinking of the country. Because of instability, business and industry have not developed properly. Prices have been raising higher and higher. People have started to blame the leaders of all parties for being selfish. Nothing has been done yet to fulfil the basic needs of the people. But the leaders have done everything in speech. Now people have changed a lot.  They have become more conscious. They can't be easily deceived by the sweet speeches. They need something solid from their leader.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">3.</span><span class="s5">    </span><span class="s1">The scene of the world has been changing every day. The dictators have come into pawer and gone out of it. Many Asian countries have been developing their economic conditions. Civil War has broken out in one country or the other, and the people have left their countries. They have lived in other countries as such refugees have become a burden to the host nations. The people of today have become more conscious of environment and wild life. They have been making progress in every field. Computer technology has changed the quality of human life greatly. The internet and E-mail have made the world like a small home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>COMPOSITION</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">1.</span><span class="s1">    </span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dear Hari,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Life isn't a bed of roses. There are many ups and downs in life. If you're happy today, don't think that you'll be the same tomorrow, if you're in trouble you think of your friend. When I joined college after my SEE, I was very happy. I had made a picture of my bright future. But all of a sudden, I got a letter from my father that he's not able to send me any money. He's asked me to come home and engage in farming. The road to my bright future has been blocked. I've to go to my college in the afternoon. That means either I have to find a part time job in the morning or go back home as my father wants.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Could you tell me if there is any other way to come out of this difficult situation?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yours forever,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ram</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">2.</span><span class="s1">    </span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dear Punam,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very glad to hear that you want to come and stay with us during the summer vacation. But I don't think that summer is a good time in the Terai for the person like you living in the hills. Although this is the good season if you like mangoes and lichis, you can’t tolerate the heat wave and the hot weather. As the sun goes higher, you'll feel hotter. You cannot satisfy your thirst. You'll drink gallons of water. As you come out of the water pond, you don' t know whether the water has made your body wet or the sweat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Why don't you come late in the winter vacation which will be quite suitable for you?</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With love from</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Binita</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">3.</span><span class="s1">    </span><span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dear Rakesh,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am very much impressed reading your last letter. Following you I've also</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">planned how to spend the next 12 months.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My college starts in Bhadra. I'm intending to continue my classes until my Dasain Tihar Vacation in Ashwin. I'm thinking of going to my uncle's house in Kalaiya. After observing the Tika festival. I'm going to visit my sister at Narayangadh. Perhaps I'll stay there until Tihar. Then the college reopens and I'll have to take classes for two months. Then the winter vacation starts on 16th of Paush. I'm planning to go to Kanchanpur. Maybe I'll go to Nainital for a day or two. I'm coming home in Magh. I don't think I'll go anywhere after that.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I'm aiming to study seriously for four months. Perhaps my exam will start in the last week of Jestha. When my exam is over in Asar, I'll come and stay with you for one month. Perhaps my second-year course will start in Shravan.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let's see what happens. Maybe I won't have to change my plans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yours,</span></p>
