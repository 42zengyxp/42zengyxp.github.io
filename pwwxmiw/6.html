The rulers tried to check the spread of education. There was no communication between Nepal and the outside world Foreigners were not allowed to enter the country. The rulers feared that people might have been political conscious and overthrown their rule. After the Second World War the rise of nationalism spread all over the world. People became more conscious. They fought for their freedom. Even the King gave up his throne for the public welfare. The Rana rule was over in 2007BS.</span></p>
