<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My dear Nisha,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">I’ve have just returned home from our three-month trip round Europe, and we had a lovely time.  We had hired a car. Since all of our family members can drive, we had no problem.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Like visitors from all over the world, we were attracted by the many cultural landmarks and natural beauties of Europe. Exhibits in museums such as the Louvre in Paris thrill art lovers. Masterpieces of architecture include the temples of ancient Greece and Rome and the cathedrals of France, Germany, and Italy. London is rich in history and royal pageantry, with famous palaces and government buildings.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Europe's historic Rhine River winds past steep cliffs dotted with the ruins and castles, built hundreds of years ago. Among the continent's many other attractions are the snow-covered Alps of Switzerland, the colorful tulip fields of the Netherlands, the canals of Venice, and the sunny beaches of the Riviera.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Why don’t you visit Europe as we did? You'd see the birthplace of Western civilization.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As you probably know, I'm buying a second-hand motorbike for thirty thousand rupees. Would you be ready to lend me the money? Since bus service was cut, it's impossible to return home on foot at 9 in the evening. Now I'm doing evening classes at PN College and my classes are over at 9. When I go to the bus- station I don't get any buses. Sometimes taxis are available. But they are not reliable and they are quite expensive. As you know my home is 13 km away from the college. It's not possible to ride a bicycle at that hour. So, the only way to return home is a motorbike. Father is unable to give me any money because he has not finished building the house. I must buy a motorbike or I must leave the college.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I hope you know me well enough to know that I wouldn't be late in paying the debt. I promise to be very responsible about this debt and pay you directly after I get my wages.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Give my best wishes to uncle Bharat. Mum says she hopes you'll visit us when you're down her in November.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Dear Sarita,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What’s the matter? It must be six months or more since we saw each other. You used to be a fairly regular visitor. Although I have sent you several letters, I have had no reply for long. I last wrote to you a month ago. I think, posting the letter to your old address. I think it must have reached you or it would come back before now through the dead post office.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We are all right here. I've joined a private college. Sarita, my brother, still goes to school. My sister has completed her first year and now she is in the second year.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Do you know that my team got the second position in a one-day cricket match organized by the local club. I practise every morning. I want to be selected for the province level tournament.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As you see my address is the same as before. Hoping to have some sort of reply by return of post.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yours,</span></p>
