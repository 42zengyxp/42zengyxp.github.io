<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dear Mum,</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You will be happy to know that I arrived here safely this morning and I also found a room in an Englishman's house. I am writing this letter in my room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This morning before I rented the room, I asked the landlord the rules of the house. He is strict about some things but not about others. I can get up so bed any time I like. He doesn't allow me to make noise, to give parties to the fire on. I can use hot water and the garden. I can cook in my room, but they have to leave the room by 7. I don't have to pay the rent every month. I can pay it once in two months.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You needn't worry about me. Take care of yourself, and give my love to all at home.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Good-bye for the present!</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your loving son,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ravi</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Composition</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The report has been prepared at the request of the Regional Council. To come to an agreement, all the four groups discussed the cheapest route for the motorway.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This region has to develop industry round Dewley. Because of the lack of communication, it has declined. The National Park in the region is an area of natural beauty. Tourism should be developed around Bridgeport, which could become a center for skiing in the mountains.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1">The existing roads form Axeley to Craymouth are narrow and winding, and cannot take heavy traffic. As the region is short of money, the cheapest route for the motorway has been selected. The road from Axeley to Bridgeport should be constructed straight. A new route had been chosen from Bridgeport to Dewley. It should go ahead through between the marsh and the mountains and outside the National Park. The road from Dewley to Crayymouth is good enough. </span></p>
