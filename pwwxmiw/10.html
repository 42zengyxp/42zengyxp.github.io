<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>Television</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In 1884 television used to be a scanning device that sent pictures short distances. This system worked mechanically rather than electronically. In 1922 an electronic scanning system was developed. The first completely electronic, practical television system was demonstrated in 1929.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In TV early days, most screens measured 18 or 25 centimetres diagonally. Today 53 and 64 cm screens are common. In the 1970's manufacturers introduced projection television systems, which beam programs onto a screen as large as 2 metres measured diagonally. Other TV sets are small enough to fit into a pocket.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Today most television programmes are broadcast in colour. Scientists have developed equipment and techniques that improved the quality of pictures and sound. Satellites made world-wide television broadcasting possible.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>Pocket Calculators</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">People in the past used an abacus. It's a frame with beads that slide along parallel rods, used for teaching numbers to children and for counting. Later they used adding machines. These machines are sometimes called mechanical calculators. They were widely used before the development of electronic calculators. These adding machines were much slower. They could add the column of figures on a strip of paper. They could be used for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing only.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Today almost all calculators are electronic calculators. When miniature electronic circuits were developed, pockets calculators were made. They are very small and can be held in a hand. This model has become popular with travelling business people and with the general public because of its</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">convenience. It is not only portable, but it can also do calculations for such tasks as school work and balancing accounts. Some pocket calculator used to solve advanced engineering and scientific problems calculators very much, people have become so dull that they can't solve even simple calculations without calculators.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>The Telephone</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Alexander Graham Bell, a Scotsman who settled in the United States in 1871, invented he telephone. Bell who was a teacher of the deaf in Boston, experimented with a harmonic telegraph, a device for sending several telegraph messages at once over one wire at night.  </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In October 1876, Bell and Watson held the first two-way long-distance telephone conversation. They spoke between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A., a distance of 3 kilometres.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">The first telephones used no switchboards. A pair of iron wires connected each pair of phones. One person called another by pushing a knob on the telephone. This caused a hammer to make a thumping sound that went over the telephone line to the other phone. As more telephones were used, each was connected to all the other phones. More than 1,000 connections were supposed to link only 50 telephones. Switchboards helped to solve this problem by bringing together the wires from all telephones in an area.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">In 1970, International Direct Dialling (IDD) began operating between and New York and London. IDD, which now serves many countries throughout the world, enables people to dial overseas directly. In 1980, a fibre-optic System tor transmitting local calls was installed in Atlanta, Georgia, US.A. In a fibre-optic system, telephone conversation system travel through hair-thin strands of glass.  A fibre optic cables began carrying messages across the Atlantic Ocean in 1988 and across the Pacific Ocean in 1989.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>Cassette Tapes</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Gramophone records were used before tapes. Afterwards open reel tapes came into use. But now cassette tapes are popular. By 'cassette we mean a plastic container for magnetic tape inserted into a tape deck to be played or used. Cassette tape measures only 3.8 mm. It encloses a miniature supply reel and take-up reel. The cassette is snapped into the recorder and is ready to use. Part of one edge of the cassette is cut out to enable the tape to come into contact with the heads and capstan.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Cassette tapes have several advantages. They can be played back immediately after being made, and the same tape can be used to record many times, by erasing the previous recording.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>Supersonic Flight</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">With the coming of flight at sonic speeds, a number of other basic design factors besides balance and stability came to have increasing importance. Among them were aerodynamic problems of friction between an aircraft and the air, and the increasing difficulty of maintaining laminar flow around the aircraft. Furthermore, higher speeds led to a reduction in surface area of aircraft wings. This meant that wind loading was increased.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s3"><b>Convenience Foods</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Convenient foods are tinned or frozen foods which are easy to prepare and can be used at any time. Canning is the most common method of food preservation in industrialized countries. In this process foods that have been sealed in airtight containers called cans, tins, or jars are heated to destroy micro – organisms that may cause spoilage. Canning plants produce a wide variety of canned foods, including fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, and soups.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">Before any food is canned, it is thoroughly cleaned. Many foods, such as fruits and vegetables are cut sliced or peeled before canning.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><b>Television</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In many countries, television ranks as a major influence on people's lives. It affects the way people spend their time, and what and how they learn. TV also affects politics, the other media, and sports. Some authorities believe that Tv has an even greater influence on young people than on adults.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A typical American or European adult spends more time watching TV than doing anything else except sleeping and working.

<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Television contributes greatly to what home viewers learn. It benefits people by widening their experience. On the other hand, TV also may contribute to harmful impressions of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No communication system has ever provided so many people with as wide a range of new experiences as television has. Without leaving their homes, TV viewers can watch government officials perform important functions and see how people in far-off lands look and live. Television takes viewers to deserts, jungles, and the sea floor.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Television programs often show people who lead more glamorous lives and have more material possessions than most viewers. In addition, TV commercials constantly urge viewers to buy various gods. Many sociologists believe that as a result, the material expectations of TV viewers are raised, sometimes to an unrealistic level. When people fail to achieve the success they see on TV, they become dissatisfied or bitter. The violent, crime filled world shown on TV may contribute to an impression of an evil world.</span></p>
