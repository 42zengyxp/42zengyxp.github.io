<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A: I could hear some children playing in the street. Then I saw a car coming down the road and stopping on the other side, just opposite my house. I could see two men in the car. I saw one man getting out and saying to the other 'This won't take too long.’ I could hear him ringing. I saw Mrs. Jones opening the door and the man going inside. A few minutes later I heard a shot from inside the house. Immediately after that I saw the door opening suddenly and man running out. I could see him getting into the car and driving away. I could hear someone in the house opposite screaming.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">B: It was a breakfast time. I was getting dressed. I smelt bacon frying downstairs in the kitchen, and heard Mrs. Jones hoovering the hall. I could hear the doorbell ring. I could feel Mrs. Jones stopping the hoover and opening the door. I could hear her talking to the man and shouting to her husband, 'It's for you.' There was a pause. Now I heard the two men exchanging angry words in a foreign language. Then I heard somebody fire a shot. I could feel the whole house shake. I heard Mrs. Jones screaming. I felt a cold sweat running down back I went downstairs. I saw Mr. Jones lying motionless on the floor and blood coming from a wound in his chest.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>12.7 RUPERT AND THE SPACE PIRATES</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">One evening Rupert was sitting in his porch admiring the night sky when he saw three bright things in the sky. To his surprise they were flying close to his house. He could see that they were flying saucers.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next day, the flying saucers landed outside the town and strange creatures came out of them. They started chasing the people. The people went to hide in a safer place. These aliens started looting. They started collecting different things from the houses. They also robbed the bank.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That night Rupert was hiding in the bush and watching their activities through his binoculars. He could see one of the aliens opening a box. As it opened the box, a mouse came out and he could see the mouse shrieking at it, the creature was frightened. An idea came into Rupert’s mind.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Next evening, he went near the flying saucers. He had collected a lot of mice in a trap. When opened the trap they ran towards the aliens. They felt that their lives were in danger, so they hurriedly flew away in their flying saucers. All the people got rid of the creatures and were very happy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Composition</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The society today has been highly industrialized and people become busier. A man has no time to take interest in another man's activities. People can't share their happiness and sorrows. A man feels lovely even in the crowd of the city. Although a man has become richer and more comfortable, he is not as happy as he was in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s5">Because of the freedom, the young people have not been able to control themselves and to make their future better. They don't have to work as hard as their grandparents used to. They have become selfish and materialistic. They don't respect their senior. They think that they know all. In the past pollutants were few, so it was not necessary to be careful about environment. But today in spite of great care, the degree of pollution is increasing every day. People have become richer, so they don't value education as</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">much as they did in the past. Therefore, the general standard of education has become lower.</span></p>
