<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I am lazy. It’s ages since I got up at five in the morning. I haven’t left my bed before nine for months. I haven’t washed bed sheets and curtains ever since my wife left me six moths ago. I’ve been washing my dishes once a week since July. Sometimes I fall asleep in socks and shoes. When I wake up at night because of cold, I cover my body with a blanket, but I don’t like to put off my shoes. I don’t keep my room clean. I want to pass my time without doing anything just thinking of my wife all time.</span></p>
