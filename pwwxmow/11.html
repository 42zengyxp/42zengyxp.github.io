<p class="p3"><span class="s1">– William Cowper</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The poem “The Poplar Field” is about natural conservation. Through this poem, he wants to give a message that it is not good to chop down trees. But, it’s not only that. It also compares the chopping down of trees to a man’s life and death. From this point of view, this poem is also philosophical.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This poem starts with the description of a forest and the changes that have come after the trees are cut down. With the trees, all the attractions of the place have gone. Neither there is the shade nor there is the sweet music of birds nor is even the wind playing there. Then the poet says that he will die very soon but before his death certainly a new jungle will not take place instead of trees that have cut down. He says that the pleasures of man are not permanent or not long-lasting. Rather, they are shorter than short human life. They finish before a man dies. To sum up, the poet means to say that he used to get a maximum amount of pleasure from the poplar trees but his pleasure has been snatched away from him.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Important Question</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Consider the poem “The Poplar Field” as a defense of nature conservation.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This poem is a defense of nature conservation. The poet’s message is that trees shouldn’t be cut down recklessly. Trees are very necessary for human beings. They are important natural resources. They shouldn’t be misused. The poet also says that though we can plant trees, they don’t grow as fast as the trees are being cut down in the present time. So, he says that he can’t see such a jungle being replanted and grown-up before his death.</span></p>
