<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting words in Correct order to make sensible sentence</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Class: 11</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be a sentence, there must be a verb e.g. go, stop. Before and after verb, there can be added different parts of speech. e.g. – noun, pronoun, adjective, article, adverb, auxiliary verb, preposition, connective</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He was studying English for four years.<br>
S +AUX+V</span><span class="s2"><sub>5</sub></span><span class="s1"> +O + PREP+ADJ + N.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Where was he going?<br>
Wh-word + aux + s+ V4?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In this way putting other parts of speech, to the either side of verb, a sentence is constructed. All the parts of speech have their certain place so when we reconstruct a sentence from jumbled words, we have to put them in their right place as illustrated above. Let’s learn from the example.</span></p>
