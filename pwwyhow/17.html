<p class="p4"><span class="s3">SUMMARY of I Have a Dream</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">‘I Have A Dream’ is an unforgettable speech delivered (given) by Martin Luther King to millions of American blacks and whites on August 28, 1963. This speech represents the hopes and dreams of all American blacks who have been struggling for their rights and freedom. Though the American constitution and the Declaration of Independence have promised equal rights, justice and freedom to all the blacks and whites, this is not implemented in practice. In American Societies, there is still strong racial discrimination, injustice, hatred and other inequalities between whites and blacks. The Blacks are hated, neglected and tortured in practice. In American societies, there is still strong racial discrimination, injustice, hatred and other inequalities between whites and blacks. The Blacks are hated, neglected and tortured because of their black skin. They are deprived of their rights, freedom, equality, and justice. They are treated to be slaves and are exiled in their own country. They live a very poor and miserable life among the rich whites. Only the whites enjoy the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Luther king addresses the American Blacks and says that they should continue their struggle until they establish equality, peace, and brotherhood in America. However, their struggle should be without violence. He says that they should fight for their rights without causing physical violence which may cause bitterness and hatred. They should follow the path and philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi. If they keep on struggling in a disciplined way, they will achieve their aims. Luther king hopes that one day; the chains of hatred, racial discrimination, injustice, and Inequalities will be broken. The new sun will rise with the rays of liberty, equality, peace, and brotherhood.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Luther King urges that there should be an immediate change in the conception of whites. Racial and color discrimination will weaken the foundation of America. Luther King says that his dream is the dream of America. His dream is the dream of freedom, justice, and equality. The color of the skin is not important. What is important in humanity? Therefore one day, all discrimination and inequality will disappear. All the blacks and whites will walk together joining hands as brother and sister. At last, not only blacks, all the American people will be free. There will be sweet music of liberty, justice, and equality all over America.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">1. What is the apparent (exact) purpose of the speech of Martin Luther King Jr.? Explain King’s analogy of a bad check (cheque).</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">Ans. The apparent purpose of King’s speech is to get the black people their rights of freedom, equality, and justice avoiding racial injustice based on the color of skin. Although the constitution of America promises equal rights to its entire citizen, black people have been deprived of enjoying the rights and get the victim of social segregation and discrimination. Therefore, Martin Luther King Jr. Delivers this speech demanding justice for the black people. King makes an analogy (comparison) between promises of an American constitution and a bad check. Though the constitution of America promises equal right rights to the entire citizen irrespective of color and creed, America has failed to pay her black citizen the rights promised in the constitution. They are given bad check i.e. false promises by architects of American constitution. If there is an insufficient amount in the bank out, the cheque of the higher amount issued against this account is not enchased and returned unpaid such cheque is considered as a bad check. Similar way although the constitution of America guarantees equality for all, the black citizens are turned down from getting justice in America. Therefore, the king compares the promises made by the American constitution with a bad check.</span></p>
