<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Dear Shankar,</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">            I got your letter yesterday. I got to know your problem of putting of weight. You had written that you were on a strict diet and eating little.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">            I think you have done something wrong in it. You perhaps don’t know how to lose your weight. At first you shouldn’t eat that food which contains fat and calories. You should reduce eating carbohydrate, meat and other oily food. The best way to reduce weight is to do physical exercise and yoga. Yoga would give you relief by making your body attractive and healthy. You can do jogging and you can go to the yoga center. If you try this for a month you surely lose your weight. I hope you will surely follow my suggestion. I hope I will get your reply soon.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Write a review for a newspaper of a recent film, play or book.</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>                                    Munamadan: A historical Film of Nepal</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>              </b>I’ve recently watch the film ‘Munamadan’. It is a Nepali film. I’ve watched it in a computer through CD.  This film really represents the picture of Nepalese youths who goes to the foreign countries leaving their family. Laxmi Prasad Devkota wrote the book Munamadan as a song, later the story is converted into a film. It is a historical and realistic film of Nepal. It is a </span><span class="s2">tragedy, based on Nepal's most famous epic poem. Madan, a lower-class worker, is forced by poverty and mounting debts to go to Lhasa, Tibet, leaving behind his lonely mother and beloved wife, Muna. However, tragedy befalls him on the way home.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">            In this film, Madan, a poor Nepalese youth goes to Lhasa to earn some money leaving his dearest wife Muna and his very old mother at his house. He earned money there. When he was coming to his house, he became sick on the way. But his friends left him alone there. A bhote meets min at night and took him to his house. He makes Madan healthy and he comes back to his house. At that time his mother and his wife were already dead in his memory. The film ends with the pathetic scene. It touches everybody’s heart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">            In this film, Deepak Tripathi is in the role of Madan and Usha Paudel is in the role of Muna. This film was directed by Gynendra Bdr. Deuja.This film has presented the typical Nepali theme of poverty and family love. The plot, dialogue and setting of the film are realistic. The songs are so heart touching and the decoration, costumes and dresses are all traditional one. I like to request all to watch this film at once because it teaches us about ourselves.</span></p>
