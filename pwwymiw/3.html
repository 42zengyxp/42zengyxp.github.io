<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Modern science has given many things tot us. Computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. It has made our life easier and faster. We can’t imagine the modern world without computer. It is the fastest means of communication as will. The internet and email has changed the world into a global village. Computer has become essential part of human life in the present world. Consequence, the users have been increasing day by day. Whether one is doing official or personal work, one prefers to use computer life, without computer, has become almost unimaginable. No doubt computer makes our task easier; it enables people to work efficiently and it prevents people from working in weather extremes. Undoubtedly it has made communication easer efficient and less time consuming. Nevertheless, computer does have reverse side too. Excess use of computer results into the loss of eyesight in the long run. Computer brings sex and violence in screen. Which result into the increment of sex violence. Teenagers utilize computer in such a way that their mind get corrupted and they cross social norms and values. Eventually such deeds are sure to bring social disorder. Moreover it makes people lazy and unsocial as they wish to spend much of their time with computer</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If we use the computer in a proper way, it has surely more advantages than disadvantages. It is the boon of modern science.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Sincerely Yours</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">                                                            <b>Advantages and disadvantages of computer</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Modern science has given many things to us. Computer is one of the greatest inventions of modern science. It has made our life easier and faster. We can’t imagine the modern world without computer. It is the fastest means of communication as will. The internet and email has changed the world into a global village.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s6">There are many advantages of computer. We can use for entertainment information and as a means of communication. We can write emails and we can download important information from internet. We can watch videos, film and songs on it. We can save data on it. It reduces the costs in the office for accountants. It has become essential part of human life in the present world. The users have been increasing day by day. </span><span class="s1">Computers are useful in business, in education and home. The use of computer has reduced time span of many works. Any works can be done sitting in a place and pressing few keys. It has enabled people to know happenings of the world shortly after it happens. Computer has made it easier for people to communicate in addition to saving time and money. The use of computer in education sector has brought changes in the age-old teaching materials. As in business and education computer is useful at home. Leisure time of family members does not become burden.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Computer has disadvantages as will. Due to use of computer unemployment problem has increased as computer can perform the duty that might need nearly six to seven workers. Unemployment is likely to result into crimes. Continuous work with computer causes loss of eyesight in the long run. Internet, which is widely used to see pornographic scenes, corrupts the mind of teenagers. Due to it, sex- violence increases rapidly. Computer has direct impact on culture of any nation. The high-tech crimes like hacking banks and important documents become possible due to computer. Virus is also a problem of it. If we put all the records on computer, if the file is corrupted with virus, all the record becomes useless. The social networking webs like Facebook and Twitter have created a kind of crazy mentality among teenagers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In conclusion, if we use computer in a proper way it has more advantages than disadvantages. It is the boon of the modern science.</span></p>
