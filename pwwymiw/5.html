<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q.Write a short article for a magazine entitled ‘keeping a dog in a flat’</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">10th March,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> 2010.The Kathmandu Post</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Keeping a Dog in a Flat’</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            People have been keeping dogs from ancient time. Dog is taken as a friend of human beings. They are kept as if our family members. It is an obedient animal. It loves its master either the master is rich or poor. It is said that to keep as dog in a flat is hundred times better than to keep a watchman in our house. A watchman may deceive us but a dog never cheats us. It guards our house day and nights without any selfish desire. It keeps the thief away from our house. Nowadays people keep dogs in their flat not only for security of their house but also for their interest to keep pet small dogs. With its keen sense of smell an hearing, dogs keep our house safe.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Keeping a dog in a flat is very difficult job though numerous prefer to do it. One who desires for it at least should have knowledge of what, how and why. Otherwise, keeping a dog in a flat is a troublesome job.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The owner should have knowledge on what he has to do. The first essential task is to teach the puppy about the time and place of doing excretion in teaching. Training is however not all in all. A good owner should know the way to talking care of dog. Dogs usually like flesh, so they should be fed with meat. Dogs should be vaccinated against various diseases. Otherwise they might cause rabies, which is very dangerous. It keeps our house safe from burglars and unwanted visitors. It is really useful for us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Composition (Page 51)</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Caricature</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Caricature</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>            </b>“Caricature”, the word means exaggeration of something. It is a kind of art to distort physical features of a person or an object. Artists create caricature basically with two purposes: to make us to laugh and to inform those who have done mistakes for reformation. A cartoon or caricature tells many things easily with in a second than in our words. Nowadays we see basically our political leaders become the subject matter of caricatures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            On our daily newspapers and magazines, we see cartoons of our corrupted leaders as will as the high ranked officials who have done corruptions and illegal works. People laugh at their cartoons. In Nepal there is the caricature festival that is cow festival or Gai Jatra.  At that time, many artists release albums, songs and visual videos for the purpose of satire and laughing. At that time we find magazines with full of cartoons. People get the information that the person is not of having good nature. The culture of cartoon or caricature is a common culture in the world. It could be found in every country and their aim is to make us laugh and to give information. The comedy artists also do caricatures of our political leaders in many comedy programs on televisions. They speak, dress and walk as if the corrupted leaders.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            In conclusion, caricature means the cartoons of our newspapers and magazines. To satire over the corrupted person and their wrong works, the artists make caricatures. It can convey a lot of message with a small picture of a caricature.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Can tell you what people’s characters are like from their physical appearance?</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"> It is said that face is the reflection of his/her personality and character. People’s character can be determined, to some extent, from their physical appearances. Many people find it impossible thing too but I don’t suppose so. After observing a person’s facial appearance minutely, I can determine nature of the person. If the person’s noise is crooked, such person is egotistical. S\he has high opinion about him\her. Other people for them are nothing in comparison to themselves. People with broad forehead are generally thoughtful. They have the tendency of thinking seriously before they do any work. They like to get involved in the observation of natural beauty. They are intellectual. Quick thinking and imaginative, but wish to know excessively about others people’s activities. People having double chin are skeptical. People who put clothes carelessly never worry about what other think about them. Such people are interested only in merrymaking and enjoyment. Quite contrarily, people who always wear clean clothes are interested in showing their superiority. They have high opinion about themselves. Nevertheless exception works in some cases.</span></p>
