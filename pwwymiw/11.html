<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>            1. Happiness</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Happiness</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            It is difficult to define what happiness is. In general sense, happiness it just the state of our mind when we are satisfied. So, mental satisfaction is happiness. Every person in the world wants to be happy but he /she couldn’t get it. Some people think that money and power give us happiness, but it is not so. Self satisfaction is happiness. In Mahabharata, It is said that we become happy when we leave our desire. Our greed and our desire make us unsatisfied what we have because we need more money and other property, then we become sad. It really depends on you. You choose to be happy because happiness never comes to a person. You see, a person (a man or woman or people) has the ability to choose. Maybe Happiness is a virtue. It is a feeling. It is a perspective. Happiness is not a permanent state, and no matter what we get, we will always swing between happiness and sadness. Just look at the miserable rich people out there. In terms of income, it has been shown that once we have a roof over our heads and food on the table, increasing amounts of money cannot buy more happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            <b>2. Jealousy</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Jealousy</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>            </b>Jealousy is unhappy and angry feeling at other’s progress. If we think we couldn’t do what a next person does, we become angry with his progress that is jealousy. For example when the mother gives delicious food to a small baby it makes the old child jealous. Sometime we become jealous even at out friend’s progress. It is a human nature to be jealous. But it shouldn’t be destructive. We should take it as for the encouragement of our own progress. If we only burn at the other’s progress, we could do nothing in our life and it would be harmful to us. For example when a boy is walking with another girl, his girlfriend becomes jealous. In films and plays we see that they become take revenge due to jealousy. If we become much jealous, it will ruin our life.</span></p>
