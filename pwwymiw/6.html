<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>                                                Tourists</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>            </b>A tourist is a person who leaves his house for at least 24 hours to visit new places. There are two types of tourists: internal tourists, and external tourists. Internal tourists are those who visit within their national border for entertainment and for holidays. External tourists are those who leave their national border and they visit strange places away from their homeland. For examples, a man goes from Nepalgunj to pokhara to see Phewa Lake and Machhapuchhre, he is a internal tourist. If a person comes from the USA to see mt Everest and goes to Namche Bazaar, he is the external tourist.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">            Tourism is also called the greatest smokeless industry of the world. Every country wants to attract more and more tourists because they are the sources of foreign currency. Due to the tourists many people get jobs as in hotels, trekking agencies, travel agencies and so on. It increases employment and National income. In terms of Nepal, nature has given every beautiful thing for the attraction of the tourists. But we don’t have the good policy and facilities for the tourists. Government should make proper planning to attract more and more tourists. Let’s hope Nepal will be the best destination for the attraction of the tourists.</span></p>
