<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Q. Tell the story of a dream you have had.</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>            </b>Last Saturday night, I saw a strange dream. I couldn’t say why I saw this fearful dream and what unfulfilled desire made me to see this dream.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            In my dream I was alone in a jungle. It was a dense forest. It was so beautiful and green that I was charmed by the beauty of it. The flowers were blossomed and the fountains were flowing in the forest. I was waiting for my friend there. The cuckoo’s sweet song had attracted me much. There was spring season around there.        </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">            I was waiting my friend. A black figure was coming towards me. At first I thought it was my friend, but later I know that he was neither a man nor an animal. It was a ghost. It had longer hair and huge body. It had longer claws and teeth. Its face was covered with long dark hair and it was laughing heavily. I was afraid with it and tried to escape from there, but I couldn’t run. The ghost laughed heavily and caught my waist with its single hand and holds me up in the air. It tried to chew my head into its cave-like mouth. When it put my head into its mouth, I suddenly woke up in my bed in my room.  I found my pillow had made uneasy to sleep. I was trembling with fear and I couldn’t sleep till the night. It was my strange dream I had seen last night.</span></p>
