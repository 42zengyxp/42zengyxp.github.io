<p class="p5"><span class="s1">1. Intelligence Tests:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Intelligence Tests</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>            </b>The term, ‘intelligence”, means the mental ability or the mental speed of a person. Intelligence test means that types of test which measures the mental capacity of a person. By asking I Q questions to a person, we can measure his/her intelligence. Sometimes people define intelligence as his ability to remember what he reads or hears. Other people define intelligence as the mental speed of a person or how a person thinks quickly. Intelligence has also relation to our ability to solve the practical problems of our life.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">            When we ask I Q questions, some people give answers so quickly, but other think for longer. The same question could be easy for a person but difficult for other. For example the same mathematical question could be easy for a student but difficult for other. It depends on the mental speed of a person. Time plays a vital role in the intelligence tests.  If a person gives answer faster than the other, he is called intelligence. Her only write answer is not counted, but the time as will. We have to give the answer within the due second. Nowadays I Q questions are being asked in different types of test and examinations. If a person gives more and more answer correctly in due time, he is considered intelligence and he gets a job. In quiz contest I Q questions are generally being asked. There are three types of I. Q. questions: verbal, visual and numerical.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">            In conclusion, Intelligence tests measure our mental ability and mental speed. By asking I Q. questions, we can measure the mental ability of a person. We can find out hoe clever the person is.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Q. If you were shipwrecked alone on a desert island, which five common objects would you want have with you? Why</b>?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If I were shipwrecked alone on a deserted island, I’d like to want to have the five common objects: a gun, a matchbox, a knife, a tent, and some light clothes.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">            I want to keep a light gun with me because it would protect me from the wild animals. It would be also needed to kill eatable animals. A matchbox would be necessary for me to roast the meat of those animals. A knife would be needed to chop the meat to eat and to cut coconuts which would be available in the island. A tent would be needed to be protected from heat and rain. There might be hot weather on the island. So some light clothes would be sufficient for me there.</span></p>
